Then, please refer to the following and write a proposal for the topic you chose!

- Category for your session
- Title of your session that reflects session details and attracts interests.
- Difficulty level
- Language of the session
- Expected duration
- Introduction of your session
  - Agenda and brief overview
  - What audiences can learn from your session.
  - Prior knowledge
  - Any references or materials to help audience to understand your session.

## Have you chosen proper difficulty?
Good presentation needs to be taken with consideration of the target audience and difficulty.

- It might not be a wise decision for choosing “Beginner” for a session that talks about advanced topics on GNOME with some C++ code snippets.
- One the other hand, It is also not a proper decision to choose “Advanced’ for Community/Social Context topics.

### Beginner
This audience has beginner experience on Ubuntu and Linux, and might not have deep understanding of open source communities. For sessions targeted beginners, Topics such as “Get started with using Linux GUI App”, “Introduction to using CLI” that would help people to jump to intermediate level are suitable.

### Intermediate
This audience has many experiences using Ubuntu and Linux, and might already be participating in open source communities. We can also suppose that they use CLI and other tools included on Ubuntu for their needs. Sharing knowledge or experiences on specific area, know-hows on troubleshooting would be suitable.

### Advanced
These audiences already have a deep understanding of Ubuntu, its ecosystems and related open source technologies, and actively use Ubuntu on their projects and work. They might also actively participate and contribute to open source communities. Topics on internal implementation, how the internal system works and its application would be suitable.

Please review our guideline above once again and see if you chose the proper difficulty level. You may update your proposal if you think the difficulty level does not fit with the topic. In case we find that the difficulty level you chose does not fit with your topic, We will contact you to discuss. Please join our discussion for a better session and experience.

## What do you want to convey to participants through your session?
The most important thing on the proposal is making it clear what you want to convey to the audience with your session.

Since only limited time will be given to convey contents of your session, it is recommended that you write your proposal concretely so that you can deliver the content within a given time.

Make sure to check the agenda and expected duration of your session once again. Since it is not easy to deliver much information within a limited time, Specify “Prior knowledge” clearly and check references included in this document.

Everything above is a required process to deliver topics and contents you chose clearly to participants.
We hope our guidelines would be helpful for you to prepare a good proposal.
